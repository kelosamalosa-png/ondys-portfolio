title: "Idle Economy Simulator"
shortDescription: "Game systems & economy simulator (balancing, progression). Public build on itch.io."
status: "live"
category: "games"
tags: ["Godot", "Simulation", "Game design"]
problem: "Game designers need to test economic systems and progression curves, but most tools are too complex or closed-source."
solution: "Idle Economy Simulator is an open tool for experimenting with game economies. It allows rapid prototyping and visualization of different balancing scenarios."
features:
  - "Visual economy system editor"
  - "Progression curve simulation"
  - "Data export for analysis"
  - "Publicly available on itch.io"
  - "Open source approach"

## About the project

This simulator was created as a side project while studying game design. It helps understand how economic systems work in idle games and how to balance them properly.
