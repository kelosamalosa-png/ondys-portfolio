## About the Project

FACHA is a mobile application built on offline-first architecture for tradespeople and freelancers who need to issue invoices on-site, often without internet connection.

### Problem

Tradespeople and freelancers spend hours on paperwork. They lose jobs, forget details and invoice late or not at all. Most applications require internet and are complex.

### Solution

FACHA is a simple offline application that allows you to track jobs, take before and after photos, write notes and generate invoices with QR code for payment – all without internet connection.

### Features

- Complete offline functionality
- PDF invoice generation with custom branding
- QR codes for Czech bank payments (ČBA standard)
- Job and customer tracking
- ARES integration for company verification
- Data export for accounting

The app is in beta and actively developed based on user feedback.
